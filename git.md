GITAM (Deemed to be University) focuses on providing a progressive and versatile learning
environment for the students in their chosen programmes, thus contributing to the general well-being of
society at large.

Given the aspirations and multitalented capabilities of the present generation student, a learner-
centric approach is adopted at GITAM. The required essentials are identified, and the students are guided
by teams skilled in various fields such as academics, sports, cultural activities, entrepreneurship etc. The
goal is to provide a holistic learning experience, enabling students to gain command and progress towards
excellence in the chosen field and become socially responsible citizens.

In this rapid digital evolution era, the role of a university is crucial to produce graduates with the
required skills. Current generation graduates need to collaborate with teams in a multidisciplinary
environment to solve complex problems and possess communication, critical thinking and technology
skills. To produce graduates who will contribute once they leave the portals of the University, GITAM
collaborates with several organisations providing a platform for the student to acquire the necessary skills.
GITAM updates its curriculum, mode of delivery and assessment tools with the current practices from the
globe.

This document provides an insight into the academic culture of the University, procedures and
regulations of the courses taught at GITAM. The regulations are designed to deliver memorable
experiences to courses that are led by instruction. All students are expected to be familiar with the
regulations given in this document and the subsequent revisions which are released from time to time.

The Schools mentioned above and are located across the three campuses at Visakhapatnam,
Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. The academic administrators of those schools are responsible for introducing
new programmes, curriculum development, curriculum revision, etc. The Schools’/Institutes' prime
responsibilities are monitoring the department's academic progress, preparing general guidelines in the
teaching and learning process, monitoring the faculty performance, student discipline on campus,
coordinating interdepartmental activities, etc. The departments/Institutes offer the programmes and
provide the instructions required to run those programmes. Some schools/Institutes are situated at only
one campus with a limited number of programmes, and students may not be divided into departments. In
such cases, the School/Institute is responsible for framing the rules and regulations right from

introducing a programme, curriculum development, teaching and learning process, providing instructions
to conduct the programmes, and leading to degrees and certificates.

5.2 Semester System
A semester is an academic term. Two consecutive terms starting with the Odd semester (I, III, V, VII,
etc.) followed by the Even semester (II, IV, VI, VIII, etc.) constitute one academic year. The odd semester
typically commences in June and ends in mid-November. Even semesters begin at the end of November
or early December and end in April, followed by the summer break. Deviations in commencement and
closure due to holidays, closures required by regulatory bodies/ Government, natural calamities, including
pandemic situations, and other reasons will be notified by the Registrar to the student's email. They will
also be available on the website. The student has to register in each semester for courses subject to
the fulfilment of pre-requisites. The maximum number of credits that a student can register for in a
particular semester is twenty five(25). The minimum number is sixteen(16), except in the final semester if
the student will fulfil requirements for graduation with less than sixteen(16) credits. Course syllabi will be
made available in advance on the website and also on the registration portal. The lesson plan and
assessment methods will be communicated on the first day of instruction and will also be available on the
Learning Management System (LMS) (currently Moodle). Classwork will be conducted as per the lesson
plan and scheduled during the timeframe of the semester. The faculty member assigned to the course will
conduct continuous and formative assessments during the course period. At the end of the semester, the
University may conduct a summative examination for certain courses. The University will communicate
the grades obtained through the student information system. These grades will also be available on the
National Academic Depository (NAD).

In the summer, certain schools may offer courses for students to fulfil their graduation
requirements and obtain grades for courses the students may not have passed. The term will typically be
for four(4) weeks, and the student can register for a maximum of six(6) credits.

5.3 Curriculum
The programme curriculum is prepared with inputs from the industry, society and trends forecasted by
various agencies. The design also takes into consideration regulatory agency requirements that govern a
programme. Program Objectives(PO) are defined and measured through outcomes to ensure that the said
objectives are met.

The curriculum includes the following,
Programme specifications: It contains the programme's educational objectives, learning
outcomes, and a detailed programme structure.

Course specifications: Course codes and titles, course classification, type of course, a detailed
syllabus, teaching and learning process, number of contact hours, credits earned on successfully
completing the course and the evaluation process.

5.3.1 Curriculum preparation:

The Faculty initiate discussions regarding the course and content, and after review, the course
content is presented to the BoS and then the AC(Academic Council). Modifications such as updations,
additions and deletions to the programme's curriculum are made based on requirements that may arise
from trends, feedback or regulatory requirements. The BoS committee may suggest revisions in the
curriculum, and the modifications will come into force after the approval of the Academic Council. The
curriculum is identified with a version number. The version number of the curriculum that exists at the
time of admission will remain in effect until another revision is made. A faculty member nominated by

Dean will act as Co-Chair, BoS. The Dean of the School will be the Chairperson, BoS. The revised curriculum
is labelled with the next version number and supersedes the previous one. The DoAA publishes the official
version of the curriculum.
Example: If the current curriculum of B.A Social Science is labelled with version 1.0, then the
revised curriculum, if it does not have significant changes, will be labelled as version 1.1. A complete
change in the pedagogy, courses, or course content will be designated as a major revision and marked as
2.0.

6 Programmes offered at GITAM
GITAM offers various programmes, including certificate, undergraduate, postgraduate, PG
diploma, and Research. Each programme is identified with a unique code.

6.1 Programme Code
Programme code is represented as a combination of alphabets and digits. The first five are
alphabets followed by two digits. The first alphabet represents the type of programme, followed by four
alphabets that represent the department/Institute offering the programme. The last two digits represent
the serial number of the programme. An example is given below.

A BCDE 12
Type of Programme Dept/Institute code Programme serial number in Dept/Institute
Example: UBTEN
U BTEN 01
Undergraduate Department of Bio-Technology B.Tech. Bio-Technology
6.2 Minimum duration of the programme
The programme's minimum duration depends on the type of program, viz., undergraduate,
postgraduate, integrated programmes, etc., and the School which offers the program. The minimum
duration of the programme for lateral admission students is the same as the regular students. For students
who have joined with the transfer of credits from the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), 50% of the credits
are to be earned in the programme enrolled at GITAM. The maximum duration of the programme is N+

years, where N stands for the minimum duration of the programme as mentioned in Annexure-I. If the
student has not obtained the minimum number of credits within the stipulated time, the Vice-Chancellor
may extend the maximum duration in extenuating circumstances upon receiving a request along with
reasons from the student for not completing the programme on time.

7 Structure of the Programme
The programme structure consists of various categories of courses incorporated in the curriculum
to impart the required levels of knowledge, skills, and attitude. On completion of the programme, the
student is expected to attain the programme outcomes as specified by the relevant professional bodies.

7.1 Courses and credits
Academic courses are based on a credit system. Each course offered in the University is allotted a
certain number of credit hours. The number of credits is based on the hours of instructional contact in the
classroom, laboratory and the amount of work the student is expected to perform outside of class hours
in a week. A weight is assigned to each instructional method as presented in Annexure-II to equalise the
differences in effort between different instructional methods. A classroom lecture/ tutorial/ skill
development activity of 50 minutes per week, spread over the entire semester, shall be considered an
instructional unit equal to one credit. A minimum of 100 minutes per week of laboratory session/ practical
shall also be considered as one instructional unit and hence one credit. Fifty(50) minutes of project work
per week with 3 hours of work performed independent of the Instructor during the entire semester is
considered one instructional unit and one credit. Eight(8) hours in a day for four weeks is required for
earning internship credits. The LTPSJC for each course represents Lecture (L), Tutorial (T), Practical (P), skill
development (S), Project work/ Internship (J) and the total instructional delivery is indicated in hoursand
the credits (C) indicates the effort.

7.2 Course classification
Courses are classified as University core, Faculty core, programme core, foundation courses, core
activity courses/skill-building courses, mandatory audit courses and elective courses.

7.2.1 University Core (UC):

Courses listed under University core are common to all undergraduate level programmes offered
by GITAM. These courses are introductory/basic to enhance the knowledge in multidisciplinary subjects
apart from the student's own discipline, thereby enabling the student to develop as a holistic individual.
The student must earn the specified number of credits in GITAM core. A variety of courses are offered in
a basket to enable the student to choose as per his/her interest and requirements in certain categories.
The courses offered in GITAM core may change based on the requirements with inputs from the Academic
Council. A student can opt for the University core courses in any semester of their study at GITAM. The
current list of courses is given in Annexure-III.

7.2.1.1 English courses
To improve the proficiency of the students in English, the English department currently offers
three courses. After admission, the student will be assessed for proficiency in English through an online
test conducted by the University. Students found to be deficient in English will have to take all THREE (3)
courses. Students who are deemed to be proficient in English may opt to take courses for learning Indian
or Foreign language instead of English.

7.2.1.2 Soft Skills courses
The Centre for Learning and Development offers a set of six(6) courses on Soft Skills. These courses
have to be taken from semester-I in a sequence.

7.2.1.3 Venture development
The University has established a Venture Development Centre (VDC) for various entrepreneurship
activities on the campus. All the students are required to take the beginners course offered by the centre
to prepare students for entrepreneurship. The VDC allows the students to incubate their ideas into
meaningful ventures. In subsequent semesters the University offers programmes that enhance the
entrepreneurial skills of the student.

7.2.1.4 Courses for overall development
The student can choose to take any TWO of the following FIVE courses.
 Sports 1
 Club activity
 Community service
 Personal financial planning
 Health and well being
These courses have been designed to enhance the holistic development of the student.
7.2.1.5 Indian Constitution and History
This course enables the student to understand the basics of History and the Constitution of India.
7.2.1.6 Gandhian Ethics
The University offers a course titled "Gandhi for the 21 st Century". This course enables the student
to apply Gandhian Ethics in day to day life.

7.2.1.7 Environmental studies
To understand the impact of anthropogenic activity on the Earth, the University offers a course
mandated by UGC. Students will have an understanding of sustainable development and awareness of
various environmental issues.

7.2.1.8 IT productivity tools
A course on IT productivity tools is offered to equip the student with proficiency in using
technology tools and enhance the productivity in assignments, report writing, presentations, etc. The
student will have to complete the prescribed Coursera courses during the Induction period, and a passing
grade in the test conducted on the LMS (currently MOODLE) needs to be obtained.

7.2.2 Faculty Core (FC):

These are the courses common across all the programmes of a School. The courses in faculty core
are categorised into various sections. Each section consists of a basket of courses, from which the student
can select courses based on their interest. Students must secure the minimum number of credits from
their respective Faculty core viz., Engineering Core (EC), Science Core (SC), Management Core (MC) and
Humanities Core (HC) etc.

7.2.3 Programme Core (PC):

Programme core courses are mandatory credit courses that the student must study to meet the
programme's requirements. The courses and their content shall satisfy the specific programme outcome
mentioned by the relevant professional bodies. The student has to complete all the courses mentioned
under this category for a specific programme.

7.2.4 Foundation courses:

These are the preparatory courses designed to fill the academic gaps and impart additional
knowledge on English, Science, Management, etc., to the students entering into university education.

7.2.5 Skill-building courses:

Skill-building courses are markedly different from regular academic courses and impart practical
knowledge, hands-on experience, exposure to the latest technology, trends of the industry, and many
others that enhance the student's skill set.

7.2.6 Mandatory audit courses:

The mandatory audit courses are the courses that the student has to attend without working for
credit and hence not counted for SGPA/CGPA. However, securing a passing grade in these courses is
required for the award of the degree.

7.2.7 Elective courses:

Elective courses are the courses that a student can choose from a list of approved courses based
on their interest. Elective courses are further classified into programme and open electives.

7.2.7.1 Programme Elective:
The parent Department/School/Institute offers programme elective courses to support the
discipline, expanding the scope in the chosen specialisation. An appropriate minimum number of such
electives specified in the programme will lead to a degree with a specialisation.

7.2.7.2 Open Elective:
The students choose open elective courses from other academic disciplines to seek exposure in
that discipline. Open electives impart knowledge in other areas that are offered within and outside of the
Schools. The integration of different domains explores new opportunities in solving problems and
improving employability skills.

7.3 MOOCs (Online courses)
In GITAM, greater flexibility is given to students to choose various courses provided through
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) during the study period. Students studying UG and PG
programmes are permitted to register for various courses on SWAYAM/ MOOCs/ Coursera up to a
maximum of fifteen(15) credits and six(6) credits, respectively, instead of courses covered under the
program and open electives. Core courses in the program cannot be replaced with a MOOC course unless
explicitly approved by the BoS. Students who intend to transfer credits by undertaking a course online
must get prior approval from the Faculty handling that course and BoS of the department.

7.3.1 Establishment of equivalency and credit transfer
Upon successful completion of the courses undertaken by the student on SWAYAM/ MOOCs/
Coursera (with prior approval from the Faculty handling the course), and an equivalent Grade/Score will
be awarded based on the Grade/Score obtained in an online course or an assessment conducted by the
University. The respective Board of Studies (BoS) will decide the grading scheme to determine the
equivalent grade and recommend the number of credits that will be transferred for the course.

7.4 Flexible Credit System
The main feature of the Flexible Credit System (FCS) is to make education student-centric rather
than teacher or system-centric. It provides the opportunity to choose the courses from a list of core,
elective, and skill enhanced courses. The students can undergo additional courses to acquire more credits,
learn at their own pace, and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to learning. All programmes of study are
designed to meet the specified number of credit requirements. The courses taken by the student in each
semester as a part of the programme are allotted some credit points based on the number of hours
assigned for teaching, tutorial, and practical. Some Non-credit (Audit) courses are also included in the
curriculum; However, securing passing grades in these courses is required. Upon successful completion of
the course, the student secures the number of credits allotted for that course. The credits earned in each
semester are accumulated in the student's records in the form of a marks memo. Once the minimum
number of credits of the programme is achieved, the degree can be awarded, subject to fulfilment of
conditions of the programme.

7.5 Minimum number of credits
All programmes of study are defined in terms of their credit requirements. The student takes each
course as part of the programme and will earn the specified number of credits for that course upon
successful completion of the course. Once the minimum number of credits are accumulated, the student
will be awarded the degree if all other relevant conditions specified in the curriculum are satisfied. Mere
accumulation of the minimum number of credits may not result in the award of the degree. Each
programme follows a structure and incorporates it in the curriculum. Every programme has some core
courses (PC), elective courses (PE and OE), mandatory courses (Audit courses), foundation courses (Basic
Sciences etc.), and core activity courses (Project work, internship, seminar etc.) with a due weightage given
to each type of course in the curriculum. Even though the student attains the minimum number of credits,
if they do not meet the pattern provided in the program structure and other mandatory requirements,
the student will not be eligible for the award of the degree. Further, a GPA requirement (currently 5.0) is
specified for each program.

7.6 Course Plan and Syllabus
Course plans are devised by the instructors based on the approved syllabus of the course. If more
than one Instructor handles the same course, course plans are typically finalised after a discussion among
all the course instructors. The Instructor will provide the following information in the course plan.

Course title, code, and complete syllabus
Course identification and classification
Instructor identification and contact details
Course objectives and learning outcomes
Required materials (textbooks, references, lab manuals, website information, videos etc.)
Couse schedule (timetable)
Course calendar (Assignment due dates, class test dates, quizzes etc.)
Guidelines for class participation and attendance requirements
Evaluation procedures (Continuous and End-semester examinations)
The Instructor will distribute the course plan to the students before the scheduled
commencement of the course using the LMS (Learning Management System) adopted by the University.

7.7 Course code Scheme
The course code is unique for every course, and it helps the students to identify which
department/School/Institute offers the course. Some courses (NCC, NSS, Yoga, etc.,) are offered by
University level wings/ organisations.

The course code scheme consists of four(4) alphabets and four(4) digits. The first four(4) alphabets
represent Department/Institute which offers the course. The first digit represents the "Level of course"
followed by the last three digits representing the "Course Number". The following example illustrates the
course code scheme.

ABCD 1 234
Department/ Institute Level of Course Course Number
Example: MECH2203
MECH Dept. of Mechanical Engineering (Dept/Institute Code)
2 Level of Course
203 Course Number
7.8 Curriculum Map
A map illustrating how pre-requisites connect various UC, FC, PC, Elective and Mandatory
courses will be included in the curriculum. Standard pictorial representations shall be used to designate

the basket (UC, FC, PC, Elective and Mandatory) to which it belongs, as well as groupings to indicate the

projected semester of offering.

8 Academic Calendar and Registration
8.1 Academic Calendar
The academic calendar consists of critical dates for all the activities in an academic year.
Information about commencement and closure of classwork, summer internship, summer vacation,
mid/module term examination schedule, state and national holidays, semester break, course registration,
etc., are incorporated in the calendar. The calendar will typically be available at least two weeks before
the commencement of each semester. The Registrar will communicate the Academic calendar to the
Departments/ Institutes/ Schools, and the same will be available on the website. The dates and schedules
in the academic calendar may change in specific programmes due to regulatory and local requirements.
In such cases, the course instructor or academic Head of the program with prior authorisation will
communicate the changes to the students. The revised academic calendar will also be available on the
website.

8.2 Academic advice
The University provides an academic advisory system to assist the student in selecting the courses
and approving the student's schedule. Each new undergraduate student attends an orientation program
before the commencement of the first semester. The student is required to consult the assigned academic
adviser well before the start of the Registration. Mentors will provide the recommended progress map for
each program to the student, which will provide information on the schedule of the offering of the core
courses. The student will make the final choices when scheduling classes, including schedule changesduring
the add and drop period. The student should use the Student Information System(SIS) to ensure that they
meet the program's requirements, and it leads to the conferment of the degree within the stipulated time.
During Registration, the student will acknowledge the information available on the SIS. The information in
the SIS will also be provided to the School and the program owner to monitor the student's progress.

8.3 Pre-requisites
Courses may have pre-requisites as specified in the respective programme curriculum. A pre-
requisite is a course that the student is expected to have completed before enrolling for a specific course,
failing which the student will not be permitted to register for the course. Completing a course implies that
the student has successfully completed at least the internal assessment requirements for the course. In
certain exceptional cases, the pre-requisite may be waived if the student has alternate exposure; this will
require permission from the Faculty teaching the course. A minimum grade may be expected from the
pre-requisite courses in specific courses such as program electives, which the Faculty teaching the course
may decide.

8.4 Minimum and Maximum load
The academic load in a semester has to be a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 25 credit hours.
Students who are on academic probation will only be allowed to register for 16 credits. If the student has
fulfilled all the programme requirements by the final semester, the student may be permitted to register
for less than 16 credits.

8.5 Registration
Every student must register for the courses opted in a particular semester during the intimated
official registration period.

To be eligible to register for classes, a student must belong to any of the following categories
i. a new student who applies for admission and receives a certificate of admission
ii. a continuing student from the preceding regular semester who has no financial dues
iii. a former student, i.e., who has not enrolled in the preceding regular semester or who has availed
academic break or detained and possessing a certificate of readmission
8.6 Adding and dropping of courses
The students who have registered for the courses during the registration period can add or drop
the courses through the registration portal. The add/drop period will commence after the completion of
the registration period in the University and will continue till seven (7) working days after the
commencement of the semester.

 Students making changes during the add/ drop period should comply with the minimum and
maximum credits requirements for the enrolled programme.
 Attendance will be calculated from the commencement date of the semester.
 There will be no compensation of attendance or subject matter delivery for the missed classes.
The students are expected to use the LMS and ensure the loss of Teaching-Learning is minimised.
8.7 Late Registration
Students have to register for classes through the registration portal during the registration period.
If the students do not register before the commencement of the semester, Registration with the Mentor's
approval and the Head of the department will be permitted within a week after the commencement of
the semester. If there is a further delay in Registration, the student has to obtain permission from the
Dean of the School before Registration. Beyond two weeks after the commencement of the semester, the
student will be advised to take an academic break.

A student who does not register for a semester will need to apply for readmission to continue the
program.

8.8 Withdrawal from a course
Students are allowed to withdraw from a course within twenty(20) working days of the
commencement of the semester. The course cannot be substituted with another course. Students who
have withdrawn from a course will have to pay extra fees to register for a compensatory course to fulfil
their programme requirements.

8.9 Withdrawal from the term
A student who wishes to withdraw from the term can do so by applying through the registration
portal. Exemption/refund of the tuition fee will be considered for the respective semester if the student
withdraws before the registration period. No refunds/ partial refunds are given after the registration
period has started for the semester. A student who withdraws from the semester has to apply for
readmission and pay the readmission fees to continue in the programme.

9 Grades and grading system
GITAM follows the mixed mode of evaluation procedure viz., absolute and relative grading system.
At the end of the semester, a student is assigned a 'Letter Grade' for each course in which they are
enrolled, based on their performance in all of the course's evaluations during the semester. The letter
grade and its corresponding 'Grade Point' represent the outcomes of qualitative and quantitative
assessments of a student's performance in a course. The grades and grade points in each system are
detailed in the following sections.

9.1 Absolute Grading
In the Absolute grading system(AG), the marks earned by the student falls within one of the range
as given in section 9.2, and each range is assigned a letter grade. For example, if the student earns 72
marks in a course, then the student will secure an 'A' grade in that course. AG will be adopted for the
following courses.

Theory courses for student strength less than 21
Theory and practical (combined )courses for student strength less than 21
Lab/Practical courses
Project courses
Internship courses
Skill development courses
Audit/Mandatory courses
In any course, if the student's strength is less than or equal to 20.
9.1.1 Grade points and symbols in absolute grading
A final letter grade will be awarded in each course at the end of the semester based on the student
performance during a given semester. The letter grades and the corresponding grade points are as given
below.

S.No. Grade Grade Points Absolute Marks/Remarks
O (Outstanding) 10 90 and above
A+ (Excellent) 9 80 - 89
A (Very Good) 8 70 - 79
B+ (Good) 7 60 - 69
B (Above Average) 6 50 - 59
C (Average) 5 45 - 49
P (Pass) 4 40 - 44
8.
F (Fail)
0 Less^ than^40 for^ Theory^ and^ Less^ than^50 for
Practical/Project
Ab (Absent) NA - -
S NA Satisfactory for Non graded courses
U NA Unsatisfactory for Non graded courses
I NA Incomplete (Only for project/Internship courses)
R 0 Insufficient attendance in the course
W 0 Withdrawal from the course
For awarding the grade, the total marks obtained by the student are "rounded-up" to the next
integer. A student who earns a minimum of four(4) grade points (P grade) in a course is declared to have
completed the course.

9.2 Relative Grading
In the relative grading system(RG), grades are given based on the other students' scores in the
same class. It indicates the academic standing/merit of the student in that class. Here, class means a cohort
of students who are taught by the same faculty member and have undergone the same assessment
pattern. RG overcomes problems encountered with AG, including inconsistency in the level of the question

paper and evaluation etc. This evaluation procedure is adopted for T (Theory), TP (Theory and practical)
and certain chosen practical courses with a class strength greater than or equal to 21. If the class strength
is less than 21 in any section, the students will be grouped with students in other sections taking the same
course.

The grades and grade points in the relative grading system are as given below. The class average
mark (μ) is taken as the midpoint of 'B+ (Good)' grade, and relative to this and depending on the sigma (σ,
standard deviation) value, the other grades are finalized. Grades are assigned based on the percentiles
determined for a normal distribution given in the table below.

S.No. Grade Description Grade Formula Grades based on
percentile for a
normal distribution
Grade
Point
O Outstanding Total Marks ≥ (μ + 1.5 σ ) 93.3 10
A+ Excellent (μ + 1.0 σ ) ≤ Total Marks < (μ + 1.5 σ ) 84.1 9
A Very Good (μ + 0.5 σ ) ≤ Total Marks < (μ + 1.0 σ ) 69.1 8
B+ Good (μ - 0.5 σ ) ≤ Total Marks < (μ + 0.5 σ ) 30.8 7

P Pass 35 ≤ Total Marks < (μ - 1.5 σ ) 2.2 4
F Fail Total Marks < 35 0 0
Ab Absent NA
S Satisfactory for Non-graded courses NA
U Unsatisfactory for Non-graded courses NA
R Insufficient attendance in the course 0
W Withdrawal from the course 0
9.3 Computing Grade point averages (SGPA, CGPA)
The procedure adopted for computing the grade point average for the semester and cumulative is as
follows:

Semester Grade point average (SGPA) for a semester is calculated as:
∑𝑛^ 𝐶𝐶𝐶∗𝐺𝐶𝐶^
SGPA = 𝑖𝑖=^1
∑𝑛𝑖𝑖 (^) =^1 𝐶𝐶𝐶^

where ' n ' is the number of courses taken by the student in a semester.
' Ci ' represents the number of credits allotted to the course ' i '.
' Gi ' represents the grade points secured by the student in course ' i '.
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA): It is calculated as:
∑𝑚^ 𝐶𝐶𝐶∗𝐺𝐶𝐶^
CGPA = 𝑖𝑖=^1
𝑚
𝑖𝑖= 1 𝐶𝐶𝐶^
where ' m ' is the number of courses graded to date.
' Ci ' represents the number of credits allotted to the course ' i '.
' Gi ' represents the grade points secured by the student in course ' i '.
The SGPA will be awarded to the students for all the registered courses in a semester. The credits of the
failed courses shall also be considered while calculating SGPA/CGPA in a given semester. For cases, where
multiple attempts have been made to get a letter grade, the last successful attempt will be used for the
CGPA calculation.

9.4 Award of class..................................................................................................................
The cumulative grade point requirement for the award of the class is as follows:
Class CGPA required
First-class with distinction ≥ 8.0*
First-class ≥ 6.5
Second class ≥ 5.5
Pass class ≥ 5.0
*In addition to the required CGPA of 8.0 or more, the student must have necessarily passed all the
registered courses in the first attempt. Distinction will not be awarded if the student fails in ANY subject.

9.5 Policy for Grades
9.5.1 Incomplete (I) Grade
'I' grade is assigned if the student has any pending assessment components. The student can
initiate the request through the Mentor, and an 'I' grade will be posted after receiving the
recommendation from the HoD.

9.5.2 Repeat (R) grade.........................................................................................................
'R' grade is assigned if the student has to repeat the course due to a shortage of attendance. The
student has to re-register for the course in the subsequent semesters by paying the prescribed fees.

∑
9.5.3 Withdrawal (W) grade
'W' grade is assigned if the student has withdrawn from the course within twenty(20) working
days of the semester.

10 Evaluation system
The course faculty will announce the framework of evaluation. Typically, the components include
(not limited to) Assignments, quizzes, presentations, fieldwork, report writing, module tests, viva voce,
semester-end examination etc.

10.1 Assessment Procedure
10.1.1 Theory
Assessment of a student's performance in theory courses shall be based on two
components: Continuous Evaluation (CE) for seventy(70) marks and Semester-end
Examination(SEE) for thirty(30) marks. Assessment in continuous evaluation is spread throughout
the course duration. The Instructor defines the schedule of assessment and is typically based on
Module tests, quizzes, assignments, etc.
For courses where relative grading is applicable, a student should secure a minimum of
twenty-four (24) marks in continuous evaluation and ten (10) marks in the semester-end
examinations, respectively. In addition, the student should secure a minimum of 35 marks to pass
a course.
In courses where absolute grading is applicable, a student should secure a minimum of
twenty-eight (28) marks in continuous evaluation and twelve (12) marks in the semester-end
examinations respectively, and the total should be greater than or equal to 40 marks.
10.1.2 Practical
Practical courses are assessed under Continuous Evaluation for a maximum of 100 marks.
Assessment in practical courses comprises weightage given to components like data collection,
experiments, observations, data analysis, results presentation, and record work submission. The
minimum pass mark for practical courses is 35 and 50 for Relative and Absolute grading systems,
respectively.
10.1.3 Combined Courses
For courses having both theory and practical components, 70% of the weightage will be for
the theory component and 30% weightage for the practical component. The student will need to
secure a passing grade in both components.
Assessment is carried out based on the criteria specified in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 for
both theory and practical components.
10.1.4 Projects
Students can perform Project work individually or in a group (not exceeding four(4)
members). Projects are assessed under continuous evaluation for 100 marks, and the student has
to obtain a minimum of 50% to complete the course successfully. Evaluation includes weightage for
periodic reviews, reports and final viva voce.
10.1.5 Internship
For internships, the student will submit a report on the successful completion of the
training. Students are required to submit individual Internship reports. The Faculty will assess the
submission, including checking for plagiarism and conducting a viva voce to assign the grade.
10.1.6 Non-graded courses
Courses like Induction Program, Environmental Sciences, Indian Constitution, Essence of
Indian Traditional Knowledge, etc., are assessed for 'satisfactory' or 'unsatisfactory'. No letter grade
will be assigned for these courses. These courses may be either of "theory" type or "practical." The
minimum pass mark for the award of satisfactory (S) grade is 40. A score less than 40 will lead to an
un-satisfactory (U) grade. Students are required to get an S grade for graduation.
10.2 Announcement of results
The Controller of Examinations (CoE) will announce the students' results at the end of each
semester. Students will be able to access their grades in the Student Information System. If there is a
requirement for a certified physical copy, students may request the Directorate of Evaluation.

10.3 Withholding of Results
Results may be withheld if
 The student has any outstanding fees, fines or other charges to the department/
Institute/ School/ University
 Action arising out of malpractice is pending
 Action arising out of indiscipline is pending
10.4 Grade appeals/ Re-totaling/ Re-evaluation
Appeal for Re-totaling / Re-evaluation of any theory answer script of the semester-end

extra fees, which will be announced when the course is being taken.

13.1 Minor
The Minor programme is a coherent area of study which is not covered in the programme the
student has opted to study. An illustrative example is given below

A student of Mechanical Engineering chooses a minor in Computer Science. Upon successfully
completing the major and minor programme requirements, the student will be awarded a degree such as
B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

13.1.1 Rules and regulations for Minor programme
The student can choose a minor programme from a department/School other than the one
they opt to enrol for the primary degree programme. The courses required for a minor
programme may be selected in any semester, as long as it does not exceed the maximum
number of credits per semester criteria.
Individual departments can also offer minors which can be a specialisation in a particular area
of interest
Students can earn their Minors from other Schools, and the BoS of the minor programme will
specify the requirements
The maximum number of credits for a minor programme is twenty four(24).
The credits earned in the major programme are also considered while computing the
requirements of the minor programme but should not be less than 18(eighteen).
Students can enrol in the minor programmes from the second semester and the major
programme courses to fulfil the credit requirements for earning a major and a minor.
To successfully complete minor programmes, the student should secure at least a passing
grade (P) in all the courses. If the student gets a fail grade (F), they have to reappear for the
same course for grade improvement similar to other courses in the major programme.
Attendance criteria and all the remaining requirements for completing the courses enrolled
under the minor programme are similar to those registered for the major programme.
For a UG student in Engineering
i. if a student opts to pursue a minor, they may be required to pay for each extra course
enrolled, i.e., for the credits exceeding the minimum number of credits required for a
programme. For example, a student pursuing a major in "Mechanical Engineering" will
require a minimum of 160 credits for the award of the degree. If there is a registration
for excess credits, the student should pay for the additional credits. The cost/credit
depends on the chosen minor programme.
ii. The student can opt-out of the minor programme before completing all the courses in
the basket. In that case, the student can choose one of the following options to utilise
the credits earned as part of the minor programme.
i. Students can use the credits earned towards a minor to meet the open elective
requirements of the major programme.
ii. The student can store the extra credits in the ABC and leave with the major
degree. Later the candidate can redeem these credits from ABC and utilise them
for awarding any academic degree if possible. This is subject to the validity of the
credits in force.
Minor programme details will be printed on the backside of the "PCMG" under the separate
heading "Minor Programme".
For students in the UG programmes in Humanities and Sciences, the student is required to
complete the minor requirements for the award of the major degree.
13.2 Honours programme
The students can strive for excellence in their own/chosen fields or disciplines by registering
for the Honours programme. The students who have strong academic standing (CGPA of 9.0 at the end of
II semester) will be eligible to pursue the Honours programme.

13.2.1 Rules and regulations for the Honours programme
The student who opts Honours programme can register for the additional courses along with the
major programme and secure the required number of credits. The concerned BoS prescribes the additional
credits required for the Honours programme.

Any individual department/school can offer the Honours programme. The BoS of the
department/School will prescribe a set of relevant courses to be studied, type of the
course to be pursued etc., under this Honours programme. The student can select the
courses from the basket based on their interest and earn the required number of credits
along with the major programme.
The students can enroll/register for courses prescribed in the Honours programme from
the III semester onwards along with the major programme and earn an Honours degree.
If a student fails to meet the requirements for securing an Honours degree, the student
will be awarded a Major in that programme subject to fulfilling the graduation
requirements for the programme.
The student can opt-out of the Honours programme before completing all the courses in
the basket. In that case, the student can choose one of the following options to utilise the
credits earned as a part of the Honours programme.
i. The completed courses may be used for Programme Electives in the major
programme if possible. Otherwise, they may be converted to Audit courses.
ii. The student can store the earned extra credits in the ABC and leave with the
major degree. Later the candidate can redeem these credits (within the specified
duration) from ABC and utilise the credits for the award of another academic
degree(if possible).
If the student opts to pursue the Honours, they may be required to pay additional fees for
each extra course enrolled, i.e., for the credits exceeding the minimum number of credits
required for a programme. For example, a student pursuing Honours in "Electrical and
Electronics Engineering" will require a minimum of 160 credits for the award of the
degree. If there is a registration for excess credits, the student should pay for the
additional credits. The cost/credit depends on the chosen Honours programme.
To complete the Honours programme, the student should secure an 'A' grade in all the
courses on the first attempt.
The attendance and all the remaining requirements for completing the Honours
programme courses are similar to the courses registered in the major
programme.
13.3 Double Major
The students can choose a "double major" to focus on two main areas of interest. Students
pursuing a major programme in any department/school can choose other major programmes either within
the same School or in another School —for example, the students pursuing B.Tech. Electronics and
Communication Engineering can select "Computer Science and Engineering" as a Double major within the
same School of Technology or choose the second major from the School of Business in the specialisation
of "Marketing".

13.3.1 Rules and regulations for Double Major
Any individual department/school can offer their programmes as a "Double Major"
programme to other students. For example, the School of Business can offer their"Fintech"
or "Business Analytics" programmes to other students who are not pursuing that
programme.
The BoS will provide a set of relevant courses under the "Double major" programme. The
student can select the courses from the basket based on their interest and earn the
required credits for the major programme. The list of courses, the minimum number of
credits, type of course (ex: theory, lab, theory + lab course etc.,) and all other curriculum
details related to the double major programme is governed by the concerned BoS offering
the programme.
The student will have to fulfil the programme's course requirements, which is opted for a
Double Major. The student will be given exemption from categories like university core,
Open electives, and minors completed in the First Major.
Students can enrol for "Double Major" programmes from the II semester onwards along
with the major programme and work towards earning both a major and a "Double Major".
If a student fails to meet the requirements for securing a double major degree, that
doesn't prevent awarding the major degree. A student can obtain a major degree upon
earning the minimum number of credits subject to satisfying the other requirements like
minimum programme duration, the minimum required credits in each course category,
etc.
The student can opt-out of the double major programme before completing all the
courses in the basket. In that case, the student can choose one of the following options to
utilise the credits earned as a part of the double major programme.
i. The student can appeal to consider the completed courses as an open elective
(OE)/ Audit course/Programme Elective etc., in the major programme if possible.
In that case, the Chairperson, BoS, will establish equivalency and recommend for
credit transfer. The decision of the BoS committee will be final.
ii. The student can store the earned extra credits in the ABC and leave with the major
degree. Later the candidate can redeem these credits (within the specified
duration) from ABC and utilise them for pursuing another academic degree.
If the student opts to pursue a double major, the student may be required to pay the
prescribed fees for each extra course enrolled, i.e., for the credits exceeding the minimum
number of credits required for a programme. For example, a student pursuing a major in
"Electrical and Electronics Engineering" will require a minimum of 160 credits for the
award of the degree. If there is a registration for excess credits, the students shall pay for
additional credits. The cost/credit depends on the chosen double major programme.
To complete a double major programme, the student should secure at least a pass grade
(P) in all the courses. If the student gets a fail grade (F), they have to reappear for the
same course for grade improvement similar to other courses in the major programme.
Attendance criteria and all other remaining requirements for completing the courses
enrolled under the double major programme are similar to the courses registered for the
major programme.
13.4 Learning by Research
Research experience, when supplemented with academics, will help one to be a better student.
Students keen on pursuing a career in Research may choose to do so by taking the first steps at the
undergraduate level. Students have the opportunity to participate in academic Research and earn credits
for the same. The student may choose to work with any faculty member in the University. The outcome
of the work will qualify the student towards attaining the stipulated credits during the programme
duration.

credit redemption to promote distributed and flexible teaching-learning. ABC provides mobility within and
across various programmes, subject to meeting the admission eligibility criteria.

Example (1): ABC provides mobility across the various programmes viz., undergraduate,
certificate, Diploma and PG Diploma etc.

Example (2): ABC provides mobility within the same type of programme, i.e., the student, after
pursuing an undergraduate programme of 1st year B.Tech. can move to another undergraduate like BBA
or B.Sc. programmes. The credits earned during 1 st year of study in B.Tech. can be redeemed for the credit
requirements of BBA or B.Sc. programmes.

18.1 Implementation of the ABC scheme
GITAM is recognised by UGC, MHRD as a Category -I, Deemed to be University and approved by
NAAC with an A+ grade. Hence, GITAM is eligible to get registered under the ABC scheme.

18.2 Minimum number of credits to be secured at GITAM
The candidate who wishes to pursue any programme in GITAM and opts to utilise the credits
earned in other Institutes through the ABC scheme should acquire at least 50% of the minimum number
of credits in the chosen programme from GITAM. In addition, the candidate should ensure the completion
of the minimum number of credits in the core subjects as specified in the programme's curriculum.
